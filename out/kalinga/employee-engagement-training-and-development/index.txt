11:T42b,These programs provide leadership development and continuous learning opportunities and have become a laboratory of novel ideas, producing capstone projects that are high-impact and relevant, and promoting themes related to sustainability, innovation, and future of work. Despite pandemic constraints, hybrid learning allowed managers based outside of Metro Manila and from offshore facilities to participate in meaningful learning experiences. Participants were able to collaborate and appreciate the synergies that came out of class discussions, workshops, and case studies. The MDP, which is geared toward high-potential supervisors and team leaders across SMC, has 148 graduates since 2017. LMDP has a total of 23 batches since 2016, EMDP has 3 since 2018, and ExecOnline has one since 2019, for a total of 660 graduates who have completed the more advanced courses. For 2022, the programs produced 120 projects related to San Miguel’s sustainability programs such as plant-based butter, and biocoal from spent grains as a source of energy for plant facilities.2:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","meta",null,{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"theme-color","media":"(prefers-color-scheme: light)","content":"#f5f5f5"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:title","content":"SMC Sustainability"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:description","content":"San Miguel Corporation - Sustainability Website"}],["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"app","children":["$","$L5",null,{"children":["$","$L6",null,{"children":[["$","$L7",null,{}],["$","$L8",null,{"children":["$","main",null,{"className":"main","children":["$","$9",null,{"children":[["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":["$","$Lb",null,{}],"loadingStyles":[],"loadingScripts":[],"hasLoading":true,"error":"$c","errorStyles":[],"errorScripts":[],"template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":["$","section",null,{"className":"not-found","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Page Not Found!"}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Could not find requested resource"}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],["$","$Le",null,{"className":"btn subsidiary","href":"/","children":"Return Home"}]]}]}],"notFoundStyles":[],"childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalinga","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalinga","children","employee-engagement-training-and-development","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$Lf",["$","section",null,{"className":"article-container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"block-content","children":["$","article",null,{"className":"article","children":["$","section",null,{"className":"description-container","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Employee Engagement, Training, & Development"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"We fully recognize that engagement, learning, and development are vital for our employees to realize their full potential.
