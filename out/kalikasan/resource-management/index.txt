11:T482,In 2022, 97% of our water withdrawal was seawater, which was used for cooling our equipment in our power plants and oil refinery. Approximately 98% of our total extracted water was discharged back safely to bodies of water at normal temperature after undergoing processing and treatment in our wastewater treatment facilities. The discharge of wastewater, whether to land or bodies of water, is highly regulated in the country and should satisfy the Water Quality Guidelines and General Effluent Standards of 2016 (DAO 2016-08; and updated DAO 2021-19). We ensure our full compliance with these standards by establishing wastewater treatment facilities across our operations. We designed these treatment facilities to properly handle the specific pollutants they are intended to treat, which can be by a combination of physical, chemical, aerobic, and/or anaerobic treatment. We also have in place a tertiary treatment facility in cases where we can reuse treated wastewater. Wastewater with high chemical oxygen demand or COD levels is pretreated using Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket technology to generate biogas that we use as fuel in our operations.2:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","meta",null,{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"theme-color","media":"(prefers-color-scheme: light)","content":"#f5f5f5"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:title","content":"SMC Sustainability"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:description","content":"San Miguel Corporation - Sustainability Website"}],["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"app","children":["$","$L5",null,{"children":["$","$L6",null,{"children":[["$","$L7",null,{}],["$","$L8",null,{"children":["$","main",null,{"className":"main","children":["$","$9",null,{"children":[["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":["$","$Lb",null,{}],"loadingStyles":[],"loadingScripts":[],"hasLoading":true,"error":"$c","errorStyles":[],"errorScripts":[],"template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":["$","section",null,{"className":"not-found","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Page Not Found!"}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Could not find requested resource"}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],["$","$Le",null,{"className":"btn subsidiary","href":"/","children":"Return Home"}]]}]}],"notFoundStyles":[],"childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalikasan","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalikasan","children","resource-management","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$Lf",["$","section",null,{"className":"article-container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"block-content","children":["$","article",null,{"className":"article","children":["$","section",null,{"className":"description-container","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Resource Management"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"We recognize the realities of our finite planet.
