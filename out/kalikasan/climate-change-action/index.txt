11:T4ad,We are also leveraging innovation across other parts of our businesses to further reduce our GHG emissions intensity. In our Beer and Spirits divisions, we recover the carbon dioxide (CO2) from the fermentation process and purify it for use in the manufacturing process. We sell any excess as industrial- and food-grade CO2 to other companies. To treat wastewater, we utilize anaerobic reactors which significantly reduce our carbon emissions from pure aerobic treatment. Moreover, our Beer and Spirits businesses have long-established initiatives to recover methane from the anaerobic treatment of wastewater and use the methane as biogas to fire up our boilers, thereby decreasing our consumption of fuel oil. Finally, we add limestone in our coal-fired boilers to reduce GHG emissions and employ wet scrubbers to reduce pollution. These key programs and initiatives embody our responsible stewardship not only toward our customers but also toward the environment. It underscores our commitment to sustainable development, as we have made every effort to go beyond compliance. We know there is still more to do, but we believe that we are on the right path toward achieving our goal of Net Zero.2:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","meta",null,{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"theme-color","media":"(prefers-color-scheme: light)","content":"#f5f5f5"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:title","content":"SMC Sustainability"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:description","content":"San Miguel Corporation - Sustainability Website"}],["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"app","children":["$","$L5",null,{"children":["$","$L6",null,{"children":[["$","$L7",null,{}],["$","$L8",null,{"children":["$","main",null,{"className":"main","children":["$","$9",null,{"children":[["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":["$","$Lb",null,{}],"loadingStyles":[],"loadingScripts":[],"hasLoading":true,"error":"$c","errorStyles":[],"errorScripts":[],"template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":["$","section",null,{"className":"not-found","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Page Not Found!"}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Could not find requested resource"}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],["$","$Le",null,{"className":"btn subsidiary","href":"/","children":"Return Home"}]]}]}],"notFoundStyles":[],"childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalikasan","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalikasan","children","climate-change-action","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$Lf",["$","section",null,{"className":"article-container","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"full-img"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"block-content","children":["$","article",null,{"className":"article","children":["$","section",null,{"className":"description-container","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Climate Change Action  "}],["$","p",null,{"children":"When San Miguel began its transformation journey from a food, beverage, and packaging company to a diversified conglomerate with investments in fuel, power and infrastructure, the stimulus was the need to propel the country’s economic growth by providing greater access to energy resources and an infrastructure that allowed industries to be more competitive.
