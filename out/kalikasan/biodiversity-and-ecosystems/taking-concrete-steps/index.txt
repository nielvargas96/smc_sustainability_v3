11:T45f,This includes establishing partnerships with various groups (private sector, the academe, LGUs, and community-based organizations) to conduct tree planting activities and re-green areas that are idle and open. For 2021 and 2022, with the assistance of City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) Urdaneta and CENRO Alaminos, the company established partnerships with people’s organizations. The first is with the NAEVAM Irrigators Association Inc. located at Barangay Nangapuan, San Quintin, Pangasinan, which became the company’s partner in the Expanded National Greening Program (ENGP) or Bamboo Plantation Program. NCC established a Satellite Nursery where NAEVAM can store and maintain bamboo propagules until they are ready for planting. NCC’s commitment is to plant 126 hectares of bamboo, and as of December 2022, a total of 35 hectares have already been planted. Another people’s organization partner is the Villacorta Greenthumb Development Association in Mabini, Pangasinan. The total area for this program is 70 hectares, for which timber, fruit bearing, and bamboo trees are to be planted.2:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","meta",null,{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"theme-color","media":"(prefers-color-scheme: light)","content":"#f5f5f5"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:title","content":"SMC Sustainability"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta",null,{"property":"og:description","content":"San Miguel Corporation - Sustainability Website"}],["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"app","children":["$","$L5",null,{"children":["$","$L6",null,{"children":[["$","$L7",null,{}],["$","$L8",null,{"children":["$","main",null,{"className":"main","children":["$","$9",null,{"children":[["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":["$","$Lb",null,{}],"loadingStyles":[],"loadingScripts":[],"hasLoading":true,"error":"$c","errorStyles":[],"errorScripts":[],"template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":["$","section",null,{"className":"not-found","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Page Not Found!"}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Could not find requested resource"}]," ",["$","br",null,{}],["$","$Le",null,{"className":"btn subsidiary","href":"/","children":"Return Home"}]]}]}],"notFoundStyles":[],"childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalikasan","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalikasan","children","biodiversity-and-ecosystems","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$","$La",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","kalikasan","children","biodiversity-and-ecosystems","children","taking-concrete-steps","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$Ld",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$Lf",["$","section",null,{"className":"article-container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"block-content","children":["$","article",null,{"className":"article","children":["$","section",null,{"className":"description-container","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"green","children":"Taking Concrete Steps "}],["$","div",null,{"className":"full-img","children":["$","$L10",null,{"src":"/page/plant.png","width":950,"height":500,"alt":"Taking concrete  steps"}]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"NCC’s Environment Management Policy states, “NCC is committed to fulfill compliance obligations to protect the environment where we operate, for the prevention of pollution, sustainable use of resources, mitigation, and adaptation to climate change, and for the protection of biodiversity ecosystems.
