The plan focuses on preventing and managing any environmental (e.g., water pollution and habitat destruction) and socioeconomic (e.g., alternative livelihood) issues that may arise.

Under this initiative, we adopt mangrove reforestation sites with the goal of protecting critical watersheds and minimizing our carbon footprint. We also train the residents of our neighboring coastal areas on how to grow and take care of mangrove forests, with the hope of providing them with an additional source of livelihood.

Now measuring close to 12 hectares, the mangrove forest has an excellent survival rate of 96%, proving the area has remained healthy.
