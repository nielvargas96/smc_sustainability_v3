            <h1>Climate Change Action  </h1>

            <p>When San Miguel began its transformation
              journey from a food, beverage, and packaging
              company to a diversified conglomerate with
              investments in fuel, power and infrastructure,
              the stimulus was the need to propel the
              country’s economic growth by providing
              greater access to energy resources and an
              infrastructure that allowed industries to be
              more competitive. The transformation generated
              a larger environmental footprint with the use
              of fossil fuels and the development of parcels
              of land into infrastructure projects, alongside
              increased water and raw material usage and
              waste generation.</p>

            <p>Cognizant of the huge responsibility we have
              taken on, San Miguel is committing to twin
              goals in relation to the environment. First, we
              aim to establish a Circular Economy Approach
              by 2040, ensuring that more of the waste we
              generate is reused, recycled, or repurposed, and
              increasing the component of recycled materials
              used in our production processes. Second, in
              response to the urgent global call to cut carbon
              emissions, we align to the goal of Net Zero by
              2050. This is not a commitment made lightly as
              we consider the balance between the need for
              more accessible and affordable energy and the
              viability and reliability of clean energy sources.
            </p>

            <p>Our sustainability governance structure plays a critical role in making sure that San Miguel
              is pursuing a sustainable business model and making a positive impact on society and the
              environment.</p>

            <p>Following are the baseline data on our
              environmental footprint and the ongoing and
              planned initiatives to forge ahead toward our
              goals.</p>

            <h3 className='green'>
              Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
            </h3>

            <p>We place paramount importance on mitigating our GHG emissions. We recognize the profound impacts that emissions from our businesses and operations have on climate change adaptation and mitigation. As a result, we have embarked on a pivotal journey to significantly reduce our GHG emissions to Net Zero by 2050.
            </p>

            <p>An indispensable step toward achieving this goal is to accurately measure our emissions in line with globally accepted GHG accounting and reporting standards. Thus, we use the GHG Protocol—the most comprehensive global standardized framework to measure GHG emissions, developed by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development—to account for and manage emissions across all activities in our Group.
            </p>


            <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="page/ghg_emission_intensity.png" width={431} height={201} alt='15.8 GHG Emission' />

            <p> In 2022, our GHG emissions intensity—or the
              amount of GHG emissions that we generate
              for every peso of our sales—is 15.81 MT CO2e/
              Mn PhP. Our Power, Oil and Fuel, and Cement
              businesses are the largest contributors to our
              emissions intensity. Our aim is to reduce our
              emissions intensity by decoupling our business
              growth from the growth in our emissions. This
              we will do by employing low carbon solutions
              and initiatives across our various businesses
              and operations.</p>

            <p>Our power business is one of the major
              contributors to our nation’s economic
              development. The energy it supplies spurs
              the growth of thousands of businesses,
              infrastructure, and investments nationwide.
              Cognizant of this responsibility, we uphold the
              government’s thrust to provide reliable and
              affordable energy to all Filipinos. In the same
              breath, we also support the country’s plan
              to have a just transition to more renewable
              sources of energy. Hence, we actively seek to
              diversify our power portfolio toward cleaner
              energy sources, while at the same time
              ensuring energy security and affordability for
              our customers.</p>


            <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="page/combined_bess.png" width={430} height={192} alt='Combined Bess Project' />

            <p>We plan to increase our 1,200 MW liquefied natural gas (LNG) and will complete 1,000 MWh of combined BESS projects nationwide, which together contribute to increasing the diversity of our portfolio. The planned expansion of our gas-fired generation capacity and BESS reflects our overall commitment to reduce our carbon emissions and support the government’s climate policies and objectives, including the Philippines’ Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>Also, we have taken crucial steps to help the
              country’s transition to renewable energy. Our
              combined 563 MW hydro power plant capacity
              is a first step toward this direction. Moreover,
              we are developing a portfolio of solar power
              projects with an initial aggregate capacity of 800
              MW across various sites in Luzon including the
              provinces of Bataan and Isabela. The proposed
              solar projects will be situated in areas with
              moderate to high photovoltaic potential. </p>

            <p>In February and August 2022, we obtained a
              Certificate of Registration from the DOE as a
              renewable energy (RE) developer for a solar
              project located in Bataan and have entered into
              a Solar Energy Operating Contract (221MWp)
              with the DOE for the development and
              operation of RE projects using solar energy as
              a renewable source (“Bataan Solar Project”).
              The lease agreements for the property in
              Bataan and in Isabela where the solar projects
              will be located have already been executed.
              Currently, the Bataan Solar Project is in the pre-development stage.</p>

            <p>Together, these initiatives serve our overarching
              goal of minimizing emissions from our power
              business.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, we have been reducing our carbon
              emissions in our Bataan oil refinery through
              various initiatives, such as plant reconfiguration,
              replacement of thermal power plants with
              steam generating facilities, and recovery
              and maximized utilization of fuel gas in the
              refinery. Furthermore, our Bataan refinery
              and fuel product terminals have Integrated
              Management Systems (IMS) certification. The
              IMS certification we have earned combines
              some of the most rigorous international
              standards on environmental management
              (ISO 14001:2015), quality management (ISO
              9001:2015), and occupational health and safety
              management (ISO 45001:2018) into a single,
              comprehensive, and harmonized management
              system. This unified approach has created
              important synergies, a stronger foundation for
              our business and facilities, and has enhanced
              our overall sustainability and competitiveness
              in the industry.</p>


            <p>In our cement business, a substantial source
              of emissions is clinker production because
              of the carbon released by limestone and the
              energy required in the process. Thus, we have
              leveraged new technologies to develop cement
              products that have lower clinker factor but
              have the same concrete strength. To reduce the
              clinker component in our products, we utilize
              supplementary cementitious materials like
              natural pozzolan and fly ash. Despite the lower
              clinker factor, our cement products still exceed
              industry benchmarks and remain versatile
              and economical building materials used in
              a wide variety of commercial and industrial
              applications.  </p>



            <h3 className='green'>We will elevate our energy conservation initiatives to include the expanded use of solar and biomass to address our energy requirements. We will also monitor, assess, and employ new energy-efficient processes and technologies that will enable us to minimize our emissions.
            </h3>

            <p>
              To further lessen our emissions from our
              cement business, we are also employing
              circularity in our operations. In 2022, our cement
              plant generated 4.58 MT of plastic waste from
              its operations and third-party contractors. To
              dispose of this waste responsibly and to reduce
              the plant’s reliance on traditional fuels for its
              operations, the plastic waste was injected at the
              pyro-processing stage of cement production,
              harnessing its useful heat for the manufacture
              of clinker. At the same time, NCC recognizes
              that it can do more to reduce its dependence on
              traditional fuel sources. Currently, the company
              is tapping into a specific technology that would
              enable a higher percentage of waste to be used
              as alternative fuel in the pyro-processing stage.
              By substituting traditional fuel with alternative
              fuels like plastics, municipal solid waste,
              rubbers, and used tires, NCC aims to cut its
              traditional fuel usage by up to 50 percent.

            <p>
              Throughout the years, our cement business has
              garnered acclaim for managing environmental
              impacts and meeting the requirements set by
              governing agencies like the Environmental
              Management Bureau (EMB) and Mines and
              Geosciences Bureau. It was awarded by
              the DENR with the Presidential Mineral
              Industry Environmental Platinum Award in
              recognition of its excellent environmental and
              safety performance as well as its community
              development programs. Our cement business
              also has an IMS certification, which highlights
              its dedication to responsible operations and its
              commitment to meeting international standards
              for sustainable practices.

              energy.</h3>

            <p>We are also leveraging innovation across other
              parts of our businesses to further reduce our
              GHG emissions intensity. In our Beer and Spirits
              divisions, we recover the carbon dioxide (CO2)
              from the fermentation process and purify it
              for use in the manufacturing process. We sell
              any excess as industrial- and food-grade CO2
              to other companies. To treat wastewater, we
              utilize anaerobic reactors which significantly
              reduce our carbon emissions from pure aerobic
              treatment. Moreover, our Beer and Spirits
              businesses have long-established initiatives to
              recover methane from the anaerobic treatment
              of wastewater and use the methane as biogas
              to fire up our boilers, thereby decreasing
              our consumption of fuel oil. Finally, we add
              limestone in our coal-fired boilers to reduce
              GHG emissions and employ wet scrubbers
              to reduce pollution. These key programs and
              initiatives embody our responsible stewardship
              not only toward our customers but also
              toward the environment. It underscores our
              commitment to sustainable development,
              as we have made every effort to go beyond
              compliance. We know there is still more to do,
              but we believe that we are on the right path
              toward achieving our goal of Net Zero.</p>

            <p>
              Moreover, we continue to benefit from
              the energy reduction and conservation
              measures we have implemented across all
              our businesses. These include the creation
              of energy conservation teams in each of our
              business units, the inclusion of power index in
              key performance indicators of our businesses,
              the conversion of our lighting to LED, the
              replacement of our air-conditioning units into
              inverter type, and the use of solar panels
              for our streetlights and for our office and
              warehouse lighting.
            </p>

            <p>In our Properties business, we are employing
              green business solutions to reduce our energy
              consumption. Examples of these initiatives are
              the orientation of our buildings to maximize
              natural lighting and ventilation and the use of
              energy-efficient systems and equipment. </p>

            <p>We will elevate our energy conservation
              initiatives to include the expanded use of
              solar and biomass to address our energy
              requirements. We will also monitor, assess,
              and employ new energy-efficient processes and
