            <h1>Biodiversity and Ecosystems</h1>

            <p>Our country is one of the most biodiverse places
              in the world, with at least 20,000 wildlife species
              which cannot be found anywhere else. Thus,
              conserving our ecosystems and protecting
              their natural habitats from significant threats
              should be of utmost importance, not only for the
              government, but also for the private sector.
            </p>

            <p>In the recently held 27th UN Conference of the
              Parties (COP27) in Egypt, nature-based solutions
              were included in UN Climate negotiations for the
              first time. COP27 “emphasizes the importance
              of protecting, conserving and restoring nature
              and ecosystems to achieve the Paris Agreement
              temperature goal, including through forests and
              other terrestrial and marine ecosystems acting
              as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases
              and by protecting biodiversity, while ensuring
              social and environmental safeguards.”
            </p>

            <p>We strongly support and welcome this positive
              development. We commit to the responsible
              conduct of our businesses to ensure that we
              maintain the balance of nature and that we give
              priority to the preservation and restoration of
              our natural ecosystems. We have stepped up
              our sustainability initiatives through multiple
              environmental protection and biodiversity
              conservation efforts.
            </p>

            <p>In 2022, we had six operational sites in the Group
              that were based in or adjacent to protected areas or
              areas of high biodiversity value. These were Petron’s
              Bawing and Amlan terminals, GSMI’s DBI, SMGP’s
              Masinloc and Ilijan power plants, and SMHC’s LCWD.
            </p>

            <p>Petron’s Bawing Terminal is located along the
              Sarangani Bay Protected Seascape, which is a
              proclaimed National Integrated Protected Area
              System (NIPAS) and also classified as a Category
              V Protected Area by the International Union for
              Conservation of Nature (IUCN). To protect the site, we
              developed and implemented a 10-year biodiversity
              conservation plan that covers 91,737 m2 of foreshore
              area along the seascape. The plan focuses on
              preventing and managing any environmental (e.g.,
              water pollution and habitat destruction) and socioeconomic (e.g., alternative livelihood) issues that
              may arise. We review and update this plan every 10
              years or less, depending on the need, to account for
              developments in the area and changes in regulations.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Petron’s Amlan Terminal is adjacent to
              the Tañon Strait Protected Seascape, which is the
              largest Marine Protected Area in the Philippines. To
              help protect the site as well as the other coastlines
              and coastal areas where Petron’s operations are
              located, Petron has created “Puno ng Buhay,” a forest
              restoration and mangrove conservation program in
              partnership with the DENR and our host LGUs. Under
              this initiative, we adopt mangrove reforestation sites
              with the goal of protecting critical watersheds and
              minimizing our carbon footprint. We also train the
              residents of our neighboring coastal areas on how
              to grow and take care of mangrove forests, with the
              hope of providing them with an additional source of
              livelihood. As of 2019, we have adopted a total of 30
              hectares of mangrove reforestation areas in Tacloban
              City, Leyte and Roxas City, Capiz, which resulted in
              more than 1,000 tons of sequestered carbon.</p>

            <p>GSMI’s DBI facility is located along the coastline
              of the Guimaras Strait, which is identified as a
              Biodiversity Conservation Site in Western Visayas
              by the DENR. In the mid-1990s, we established a
              mangrove reforestation area along the coastline
              where the distillery is located. Now measuring close
              to 12 hectares, the mangrove forest has an excellent
              survival rate of 96%, proving the area has remained
              healthy. These mangroves were also planted
              to contribute to the conservation of the natural
              biodiversity of the Guimaras Strait and to
              reduce the risk of flooding and soil erosion. We
              also conduct tree planting activities in the area
              every year.</p>

            <h3 className='green'>We will safeguard the
              well-being of the natural
              habitats and ecosystems
              where we operate. We will
              continue to work with
              others toward a world
              where biodiversity is
              valued and conserved.</h3>

            <p>Furthermore, we constantly monitor Guimaras
              Strait’s coastline to ensure that the surrounding
              area is always kept clean. One of GSMI’s
              longest-running biodiversity conservation
              activities is regular coastal cleanups in
              collaboration with LGUs and volunteers from
              nearby communities.</p>

            <p>SMGP’s Masinloc Power Plant is situated along
              Oyon Bay, a protected landscape and seascape
              by virtue of the Expanded NIPAS Act; while
              the Ilijan Power Plant is located by the Verde
              Island Passage, which is recognized as the
              center of global shore-fish biodiversity. SMGP
              has developed a biodiversity management
              system that safeguards the ecosystems around
              these protected areas. We have long-standing
              partnerships with environmental experts,
              government agencies, and local communities
              that implement tree planting, mangrove
              reforestation, and coral rehabilitation projects.
              One of our biggest initiatives is Project 747,
              which aims to plant over 7 million upland and
              mangrove trees over 4,000 hectares of land in at
              least seven provinces nationwide. </p>

            <p>Lastly, SMHC’s LCWD is near the Angat
              Watershed Forest Reserve, which protects the
              drainage basin in the southern Sierra Madre
              range north of Metro Manila. SMHC completed
              the planting of over 26,000 trees in Angat,
              Bulacan together with the town’s
              Dumagat communities. In partnership with the
              Dumagats, SMHC was able to cover the first
              16 of 55 hectares targeted for planting with
              dipterocarp tree species like white and red
              lauan, palosapis, apitong, yakal, guijo, and other
              indigenous species such as bignai and narra.
              This initiative is part of SMGP’s Project 747.
              Furthermore, we also partnered with
              Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System
              (MWSS) to launch an annual Million Tree
              Planting Challenge to replenish the forest cover
              of 126 hectares of the Angat Dam Watershed
              within three years. Under this challenge, our
              employees have planted 6,400 trees (including
              3,200 Narra and Guyabano tree varieties)
              over 14 hectares at the Angat Dam Watershed
              since 2019.</p>

            <p>In the coming years, we will implement more
              large-scale changes with both the private sector
              and the government to help halt biodiversity
              loss. We will safeguard the well-being of the
              natural habitats and ecosystems where we
              operate. We will continue to work with others
              toward a world where biodiversity is valued and
              conserved.

            <p>In 2022, San Miguel Foods launched a
              coral reef rescue program to help protect
              and preserve the rich marine biodiversity
              of Anilao in Mabini, Batangas, where the
              company’s flour milling plants and grain
              terminal are located.</p>

            <p>Recognizing that coral reefs are a vital ecosystem
              for life underwater, we identified an area close
              to Barangay San Teodoro, in the southern part of
              Mabini, as the pilot coral rescue site. Ten volunteer
              divers, under the supervision of a marine biologist,
              transplanted 100 corals at a depth of nine meters.
              The site is expected to achieve a survival rate of
              60% and further contribute to the growth of the
              fish population. </p>

            <p>The site is monitored regularly to measure the
              program’s effectiveness in terms of fish biomass
              and the number of fish species in the area. As the
              coral community develops, the fish community and
              other reef-associated organisms are expected to
              flourish.</p> */}

            </div>

            <p>For four years and counting, San Miguel
              Global Power, in partnership with
              its foundation, has been planting
              over six million upland trees and
              mangroves nationwide under its flagship
              environmental initiative Project 747.
            </p>

            <p>The Project is on track to meet its multi-year
              goal of growing seven million trees across four
              thousand hectares of degraded forest lands, in at
              least seven key provinces in the Philippines.</p>

            <p>Growing, not just planting trees, is the main
              determinant of success. Close partnerships with
              the DENR and local communities—particularly
              fishers and farmers’ groups- are crucial to
              achieving this. </p>

            <p>It is the role of the local DENR offices and
              community partners to identify indigenous tree
              varieties to be planted, nurture young trees,
              and ensure their growth. Through their efforts
              and SMGP’s continued support, survival rates of
              planted upland trees were at 90%, and mangrove
              propagules at 89%, as of January 2023.
            </p>

            <p>To date, SMGP has planted 6,527,895 upland and
              mangrove trees across 2,000 hectares of land, in
              eight provinces: Albay, Bataan, Bulacan, Davao Occidental,
              Negros Occidental, Pangasinan, Quezon
              province, and Zambales.</p>

            <p>The list is expected to grow as SMGP is committed
              to reforesting areas near its BESS facilities in Albay,
              Bohol, Cagayan, Cebu, Davao del Norte, Davao de Oro,
              Isabela, Laguna, Leyte, Misamis Oriental, Pampanga,
              Pangasinan, and Tarlac.</p>

            <p>Across the San Miguel Group, other major
              reforestation initiatives have been successfully
              implemented, and continue to this day. These include
              San Miguel Brewery’s long-running “Trees Brew Life”
              program and similar projects by Ginebra San Miguel,
              Petron Corporation, and SMC Infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Project 747 is by far the most expansive and most
              ambitious, yet. It targets to rehabilitate 2,800
              hectares of upland forests and 1,204 hectares of
              mangrove forests. Tree varieties used in upland
              plantations include narra, molave, white lauan,
              palosapis, agoho, batino, igang, and malabayabas,
              while mangrove varieties include bakawan babae,
              bakawan lalaki, bungalon, and api-api. </p>

            <p>The program is aligned with SMGP’s thrust to help
              mitigate the impacts of climate change by lowering
              its carbon footprint through this nature-based
              carbon capture initiative.</p> */}

            <p>Since its inception in September 2022, the
              program has provided members of the community
              with the opportunity to rent or purchase fish nets
              to improve their income and secure their financial
              future. The initiative operates as a revolving fund,
              with revenue generated being used to acquire
              more fishnets for the association’s members to
              rent and eventually own.</p>

            <p>In just a few months, by December 2022, the
              program doubled its initial investment, enabling
              more members to make a steady living from
              fishing. So far, the program has made a positive
              impact on the lives of 150 fishermen.</p>

              DBI recognizes the importance of empowering
              individuals to build their livelihoods. By providing
              opportunities for the FisherFolks Association to

                <b>Establishment of Reforestation Areas.</b>
                <p>This includes establishing partnerships with
                  various groups (private sector, the academe,
                  LGUs, and community-based organizations) to
                  conduct tree planting activities and re-green areas
                  that are idle and open. For 2021 and 2022, with
                  the assistance of City Environment and Natural
                  Resources Office (CENRO) Urdaneta and CENRO
                  Alaminos, the company established partnerships
                  with people’s organizations. The first is with the
                  NAEVAM Irrigators Association Inc. located at
                  Barangay Nangapuan, San Quintin, Pangasinan,
                  which became the company’s partner in the
                  Expanded National Greening Program (ENGP) or
                  Bamboo Plantation Program. NCC established a
                  Satellite Nursery where NAEVAM can store and
                  maintain bamboo propagules until they are ready
                  for planting. NCC’s commitment is to plant 126
                  hectares of bamboo, and as of December 2022, a
                  total of 35 hectares have already been planted.

                </small></span></b> </p>

                <p>NCC also joined the national celebration of
                  Arbor Day on June 25, 2022 by conducting tree
                  planting and officially launching its Arboretum in
                  a 2-hectare property located in Sapid Mini Forest.
                  The Arboretum houses various endemic and fruit
                  bearing trees such as palosapis, lauan, narra,
                  cacao, balimbing, guyabano, and makopa.</p>

                <p>As the development at the Mining Area
                  continues, NCC ensures that topsoil is saved for
                  reforestation. To date, a total of 4,714 MT of topsoil
                  are stored at the stockpile area for reforestation
                  activities and nursery use. Sapid Forest has been
                  an area for various environmental management
                  activities such as seedling propagation and
                  production, seed germination, and hunting of
                  wildings for propagation. A clonal facility, where
                  stem cuttings are used to reproduce seedlings,
                  has been expanded for use in research programs
                  and propagation of citrus fruits and other
                  dipterocarp trees. </p>

                <p>NCC also involves local communities in its various
                  environmental programs. This year, the company
                  partnered with Bangol Canit Ibaloi Samahang
                  Tribu Sa Kaunlaran, a community-based forest
                  management association located in Barangay
                  Inmalog, Sison, which is one of its neighboring
                  communities. As part of the collaboration, NCC
                  provided the association with the necessary
                  resources, including a nursery and essential
                  tools, to help them establish their own seedling
                  production. In return, the association sells
                  seedlings to NCC for its greening and reforestation
                  initiatives. This mutually beneficial partnership is
                  set to continue until 2026, during which period,
                  NCC will purchase 35,000 seedlings from the
                  association, while the association and its members
                  will earn an estimated income of 1.35 million PhP.</p>

                <p>NCC’s commitment to environmental sustainability
                  and community empowerment is further
                  showcased by its National Greening Program and
                  Mining Forest Program. From July 2021 to June
                  2022, NCC successfully planted 15,995 seedlings
                  over 15.4 hectares, as part of its National Greening
                  Program. Additionally, as part of its Mining
                  Forest Program, it planted 200 seedlings over 0.8
                  hectares during the same period.</p>

              <li> <b>Water Resources.</b>
                <p>To ensure that all water leaving its facility is free
                  from harmful contaminants, NCC continuously
                  maintains all silting ponds, draining canals, and oil
                  and water separators, which are crucial in filtering
                  out any pollutants from the water. Additionally,
                  it regularly conducts clean-up drives along four
                  creeks that receive the discharged water: Buli
                  Creek, Bagutan Creek, Kubuar Creek, and Sapid
                  Creek. To further guarantee the safety of its
                  discharged water, NCC conducts monthly internal
                  water sampling, with results consistently meeting
                  DENR effluent standards. These results are
                  verified through testing carried out by an external
                  DENR-accredited testing center. Moreover, NCC
                  also ensures the proper disposal of all hazardous
                  waste generated during its operations. All
                  hazardous waste is labeled, stored, and disposed
                  properly through DENR-accredited waste haulers,
                  with no chemicals or hazardous waste ever being
                  disposed of in local water bodies.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <b> Noise and Vibration. </b>
                <p>To ensure that its operations are within the
                  acceptable noise levels according to DOLE and
                  DENR standards, NCC conducts its own ambient
                  noise level monitoring at Sitio Saguitlang in
                  Barangay Labayug and Barangay Inmalog.
                  Furthermore, during blasting operations, NCC
                  works with Delta Earth Moving Inc. to monitor
                  vibration levels using specialized vibrometer
                  equipment. This ensures that the vibrations
                  caused by our operations are within the required
                  parameters, and that any potential risks to nearby
                  communities or infrastructure are minimized.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Air Quality.</b>
                <p>To control dust and emissions generated during
                  quarry operations, NCC uses water trucks at the
                  Shale and Limestone Quarry to suppress dust
                  generated during blasting operations. Additionally,
                  it employs a vacuum truck to siphon dust along
                  paved roads. Plans are in place to procure a
                  new and more efficient vacuum truck, which will
                  increase the existing equipment’s capability.
                  Furthermore, NCC conducts regular emission
                  testing of heavy equipment involved in quarry
                  operations. It also carries out internal monthly
                  ambient air monitoring at all identified sampling
                  points, in addition to confirmatory sampling
                  conducted during Multipartite Monitoring Team
                  visits. All test results have passed and are within
                  the DENR parameters, indicating that NCC’s
                  measures are effective in controlling emissions
                  and ensuring the air quality in the surrounding
                  communities.</p>

                      preservation of flora and fauna is essential
                      for maintaining ecological balance. To develop
                      effective conservation and preservation programs,
                      the company must first determine the occurrence
                      and distribution of the various plant and animal
                      species thriving within the NCC’s MPSA. By doing
                      so, NCC can define and implement measures that
                      will help protect these species and their habitats.</p>

                  <li><b>Siltation Pond Efficiency</b>
                    <p>Quarry areas are sources of silt and sediments
                      that have the potential to cause adverse
                      impacts on aquatic ecosystems and downstream
                      communities if not properly managed. These
                      impacts can be mitigated through a number of
                      techniques. During quarry operations, silt is often
                      suspended in the water, and if left unchecked, can
                      harm sensitive aquatic organisms. To address this,
                      NCC conducts Siltation Pond Efficiency Research
                      to assess, evaluate, and monitor the sedimentation
                      rate of all siltation ponds. This research helps
                      the company develop environmental programs
                      and assess the effectiveness of its mitigating
                      measures. </p>
