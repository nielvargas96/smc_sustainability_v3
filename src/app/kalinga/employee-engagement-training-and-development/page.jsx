            <h1>Employee Engagement, Training, & Development</h1>

            <p>We fully recognize that engagement, learning,
              and development are vital for our employees to
              realize their full potential. As such, we strive to
              provide the requisite competencies and skills
              for them to succeed in their roles, to increase
              productivity, and produce a stable pool of talent
              for future leadership opportunities. </p>

            <p>Upskilling and reskilling gained heightened
              importance in 2022 with the growing shifts
              in the way business is done. It became an
              imperative strategy for companies to enhance
              their learning and development programs to
              respond to the emerging needs of business.</p>

            <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="/page/training_hours.png" width={399} height={213} alt='Training Hours' />

            <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="/page/training_hours2.png" width={398} height={186} alt='Training Hours' />

            <p>In 2022, our employees logged a total of over
              593,000 learning hours, up by 88% compared
              to the previous year. Online learning increased
              when CHR partnered with LinkedIn Learning
              and Udemy, which allowed training and
              development to expand its reach Groupwide.
              Learning administrators in each business unit
              were trained to do content curation to develop
              learning pathways in the LinkedIn Learning
              platform. These learning pathways were
              assigned to identified employees for completion,
              resulting in more than 238,000 content
              completions on the platform. Learning in groups
              also increased as sessions on the platform
              were conducted in larger forums to create a
              sense of community among employees in our
              plants and sales facilities. Onboarding and
              learning conversations were made available as
              well using online collaboration tools such as
              Microsoft Teams and Zoom.</p>

            <p>The development of high-potential and high-performing employees is a particular focus area
              in SMC. In addition to purposive career paths,
              coaching and mentoring, there are advanced
              learning programs where these employees
              can further hone their skills. These are the
              following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Management Development Program (MDP),
                  run by Corporate HR;
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Leadership and Management Development
                  Program (LMDP), run by the Ateneo Graduate
                  School of Business;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Executive Management Development
                  Program (EMDP), run by the Asian Institute of
                  Management; and
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>ExecOnline, run by globally recognized
                  institutions such as the Columbia School of
                  Business and the University of California
                  Berkeley.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>These programs provide leadership
              development and continuous learning
              opportunities and have become a laboratory of
              novel ideas, producing capstone projects that
              are high-impact and relevant, and promoting
              themes related to sustainability, innovation, and
              future of work. Despite pandemic constraints,
              hybrid learning allowed managers based
              outside of Metro Manila and from offshore
              facilities to participate in meaningful learning
              experiences. Participants were able to
              collaborate and appreciate the synergies that
              came out of class discussions, workshops, and
              case studies. The MDP, which is geared toward
              high-potential supervisors and team leaders
              across SMC, has 148 graduates since 2017.
              LMDP has a total of 23 batches since 2016,
              EMDP has 3 since 2018, and ExecOnline has
              one since 2019, for a total of 660 graduates who
              have completed the more advanced courses.
              For 2022, the programs produced 120 projects
              related to San Miguel’s sustainability programs
              such as plant-based butter, and biocoal from
              spent grains as a source of energy for plant
              facilities.</p>

            <p>Apart from leadership and work-related
              competencies, programs are also offered for
              holistic well-being, health, and creative talent
              development. These are in the form of webinars,
              individual consultation, interest groups, and
              even internal competitions. </p>

            <p>Finally, we conduct employee volunteer
              programs that help cultivate an engaged
              workforce, such as Volunteers in Action
              program by Petron, visitation to Saguitlang
              pupils by NCC, and various employee-initiated
              programs in provincial locations.
            </p>

            <h3 className='orange'>Apart from leadership
              and work-related
              competencies, programs
              are also offered for
              holistic well-being,
              health, and creative talent
              development.
            </h3>

            <p>Performance reviews are an important
              mechanism to drive the achievement of
              business goals and strategic initiatives. Given
              agreed goals at the start of the year, the
              employee’s performance is rated objectively
              based on the achievement of these goals by
              year-end. Also included in the review is an
              assessment of the employee’s strengths
              and areas for development, as well as
              developmental plans. For officers, middle
              managers, and non-unionized rank and file
              employees, the performance rating becomes the
              basis for salary increases in the following year.
              For unionized employees, salary increases are
              governed by their CBAs; nevertheless, some of
              them still undergo performance reviews.</p>


            <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="/page/JOB_CATEGORY.png" width={717} height={213} alt='Job Category ' />




            <p>While performance reviews are expected to be
              completed for all officers, middle managers,
              and non-unionized employees, the actual
              compliance rate is still below standard. Between
              women and men, a higher percentage of women
              undergo performance reviews. To facilitate the
              performance review process, San Miguel piloted
              the use of SAP Success Factors as its platform
              for human capital management in 2018 and has
              progressively increased both the application
              modules activated and the organizational units
              migrated to the platform. The goal of HR is not
              only to attain a comprehensive coverage of
              performance reviews, but also to enhance its
              value as a motivational and developmental tool. </p>

            <p>Moving forward, one of our imperative
              development tasks is to raise awareness and
              build capability for sustainability among our
              employees across the Group. We are working on
              a combination of internal and external programs
              to equip our employees in ESG, including setting
              up a knowledge platform to serve as a groupwide repository of ESG resources and data and
              launching employee engagement programs to
              instill an ESG mindset in our workforce.</p>

            <p>For over a century, SMC has built a
              legacy of creating world-class products
              that are recognized globally. To achieve
              this, the company recognizes that its
              employees are its most valuable asset,
              and investing in them is key to excellence,
              innovation, and quality. That is why SMC
              has established in-house schools for its
              employees across various business units
              to develop specialized skills, keep up with
              industry trends, and drive innovation.
            </p>

            <Image style={{ borderRadius: '0' }} src="/page/JOB_CATEGORY2.png" width={717} height={198} alt='Job Category 2' />

            <p>One such in-house school is the San Miguel School
              of Brewing, which has been the primary institute
              for developing future brewmasters, quality
              assurance professionals, technical specialists,
              and brewery engineers since its creation in 1975.
              The school has produced brewmasters and other
              key technical people, and today, it is an accredited
              provider for Continuing Professional Development
              (CPD) of the Professional Regulation Commission
              (PRC) Councils of Chemical Engineering,
              Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical
              Engineering. This means that employees not only
              gain the knowledge and skills needed to advance
              their careers but can also obtain necessary CPD
              credits to maintain their licenses.</p>

            </div>

            <p>San Miguel Foods University, on the other hand,
              has 16 schools offering more than 100 courses
              in various fields such as feed milling, poultry
              and meats live and processing operations, flour
              milling and applications technology, and basic
              quality assurance, among others. This in-house
              school not only allows employees to obtain the
              necessary knowledge and skills to perform their
              jobs well and expand their career opportunities,
              but also offers those in technical professions, such
              as chemists, chemical, electrical, and mechanical
              engineers, veterinarians, and food technologists,
              an opportunity to obtain the required CPD
              credits from the PRC to keep their licenses. The
              school has introduced digital learning to provide
              employees with greater flexibility in accessing
              educational resources at their own pace, a feature
              that is particularly useful for employees on
              manufacturing shifts. </p>


            <div className='full-img'>
              <Image src="/page/employee_development.png" quality={100} width={900} height={500} alt='Inside Feed Mill' />
            </div>
            <p>GSMI has also established six in-house schools
              that cover a range of disciplines, such as
              manufacturing, sales, logistics, human resources,
              and liquor making. One of these schools is the
              Alcohol and Liquor Technology Institute, which
              focuses on developing alcohol sensory experts and
              honing employee skills in alcohol making. In 2022,
              GSMI offered a total of 35 courses with a combined
              196 CPD credits. This initiative not only boosts
              employee morale and skill sets but also raises the
              bar for the industry as a whole.</p>

            <p>In-house schools are not a new concept, but San
              Miguel Corporation’s commitment to employee
              development and growth sets it apart from the
              rest. The in-house schools not only foster a culture
              of learning and innovation but also ensure that its
              products remain of the highest quality. With SMC’s
              in-house schools, employees can take their careers
              to new heights, while the company remains at the
              forefront of innovation and excellence.</p> */}
