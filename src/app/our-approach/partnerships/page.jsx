            <p>We view our shareholders and investors as our
              partners who support the Company’s vision and
              strategies, providing the capital requirements
              that fuel the long-term business growth
              aspirations of SMC. As such, they play an
              important role in SMC’s sustainable evolution
              and future value creation. We believe that our
              sustainability aspirations should be shaped
              together with our shareholders and investors
              through constant feedback and open dialogue. </p>

            <p>To ensure open communication and
              transparency, we conduct monthly and quarterly
              meetings with our Board of Directors and
              various Board-level committees. We hold
              annual stockholders’ meetings, a venue for
              all shareholders to hear about the company’s performance and plans and to air their
              comments and questions. We engage with our
              investors through one-on-one meetings, deal
              and non-deal roadshows, teleconferences, and
              email correspondences. We release PSE and
              Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. (PDEX)
              disclosures on a regular basis, hold quarterly
              investor briefings, and send out E-newsletters.
              On the ESG front, SMC holds engagement
              meetings within the group and with external
              parties to discuss our ESG ratings and various
              initiatives we can adopt to address ESGrelated concerns. The open flow of dialogue
              and exchange of information on our goals and
              strategies will ensure the Company is on the
              right track toward more sustainable growth. </p>


            <h3 className='blue'>Employees</h3>
            <p>We view our employees as the heart and soul of
              the Company, partners in realizing our Group’s
              strategy and purpose and together responsible
              for advancing our ESG agenda. As of 2022, SMC
              had a total of 50,008 employees working in the
              domestic operations of the subsidiaries covered
              by this Report. </p>

            <p>SMC employs qualified, skilled and experienced
              personnel to manage our business and run our
              operations. We offer compensation and benefits
              packages that are competitive within the
              respective industries that each business is in to
              ensure adequate manning of critical positions.
            </p>

            <p>We have established succession planning
              programs for key positions to ensure continuity
              of leadership and preservation of technical
              expertise.</p>

            <p>We realize the importance of upholding labor
              laws; therefore, we endeavor to maintain good
              labor relations by keeping an open line of
              communication with our employees. This we do
              through various employee relations and internal
              communications programs, including employee
              engagement surveys, to achieve high levels of
              employee satisfaction.</p>

            <h3 className='blue'>Customers</h3>
            <p>We recognize our customers’ continued loyalty
              as a vital part of our Company’s success. We
              view our customers as patrons at the receiving
              end of all our products and services offerings.
              As such, we strive to produce quality products
              that are affordable and services that provide the
              best customer care. This can only be achieved
              by keeping up with the customers’ evolving
              preferences through customer satisfaction
              surveys, customer engagement initiatives, field
              visits and social media monitoring. </p>

            <p>We use a mix of traditional and non-traditional
              communication channels for our products and
              services. We aim to be present in the minds of
              the everyday customer by means of product
              marketing campaigns, social media launches,
              and traditional forms of advertising such as TV,
              radio, and out-of-home advertising. Consistency
              and harmonization of our marketing and
              packaging efforts are of utmost importance as
              lack of these may send conflicting messages to
              our valued customers.</p>

            <p>We secure trademarks and proprietary rights to
              ensure that our brands are not compromised.
              Our business units have skilled marketing and
              sales teams that handle customer relations
              and are trained in the right ways to receive and
              respond to customer feedback. All our products
              comply with standards set by the Department
              of Trade and Industry, Food and Drug
              Administration, and other regulatory entities. </p>

            <p>All these allow SMC to closely monitor and
              ascertain that our products maintain their
              quality and availability to our customers.</p>

            <h3 className='blue'>
              Suppliers and Vendors
            </h3>

            <p>We contribute to the growth of downstream
              industries and sustain a network of thousands
              of third-party suppliers as a result of our
              extensive portfolio of products and services.
              We see our suppliers and vendors as partners
              in value creation who provide us with vital
              products and services that satisfy the
              Company’s quality standards and requirements.</p>

            <p>Suppliers applying for accreditation pass
              through our Corporate Procurement Group for
              audit and assessment and are screened for
              business ethics, environmental, health, and
              safety compliance, and financial capability. We
              also enhanced our Supplier Code of Conduct
              to include ESG metrics. Moreover, materials
              and supplies requirements undergo strict
              evaluation to ensure conformity with Company
              requirements. Finally, we conduct orientations
              with accredited suppliers to ensure alignment
              with SMC’s Supplier Code of Conduct. </p>

            <h3 className='blue'>Local Communities</h3>
            <p>Our operations span the whole Philippine
              archipelago with products available from
              the smallest to the biggest business
              establishments. Our manufacturing facilities,
              power plants, fuel terminals, and service
              stations are strategically located in many
              communities around the country.</p>

            <p>We engage with the communities where we
              operate, even as early as the planning stages
              of our projects. For instance, we conduct an
              extensive study covering Environment Impact
              Assessment and coordinate with LGU and
              barangay officials through open dialogues with
              the aim of building mutual trust.</p>

            <p>SMC implements programs that foster
              harmonious working relationships with our
              host communities and LGUs. We understand
              that engaging with our communities is a longterm commitment that goes beyond just oneoff events or programs. It is about building
              meaningful relationships where we help each
              other grow and succeed.</p>

            <p>Through San Miguel Foundation, we strive
              to connect with local communities and seek
              mutually beneficial partnerships by providing
              livelihood opportunities and education and
              by supporting local government projects. In
              addition, we operate and manage community
              clinics to provide residents access to urgently
              needed health and medical services. </p>

            <p>We are also committed to protecting the rights
              of indigenous peoples (IPs) in the areas where
              we operate in coordination with the National
              Institute for Indigenous Peoples. In 2022,
              the Group upheld its commitment to respect
              the rights of IPs, and there were no reported
              incidents of violations. </p>

            <p>Through the SMC Global Power Foundation,
              we directly work with indigenous groups in
              the province of Zambales, particularly in the
              municipalities of Palauig and Botolan. Our
              initiatives include the Biochar Community
              Enterprise Development Project, where we
              partner with the local communities to produce
              and utilize biochar as an organic fertilizer that
              enhances the survival rate of trees. This project
              complements our forest rehabilitation program
              in the area. We also hold annual Christmas giftgiving, and medical and dental missions in these
              communities. In Angat, we actively engage with
              the local indigenous population through various
              livelihood, community empowerment, education,
              social, and health programs — all while
              protecting the environment and the Kabayunan
              Ancestral Domain.</p>

            <p>Parallel to this is Petron Foundation, Inc.
              (PFI), which implements the CSR initiatives of
              Petron for its host communities nationwide.
              Under the banner of Fueling HOPE (Helping
              Filipino children and youth Overcome
              Poverty through Education), PFI is providing
              scholarships from elementary through college,
              building classrooms, and actively supporting
              DepEd’s Brigada Eskwela. It also supports
              the government’s National Greening Program
              through the Puno ng Buhay reforestation
              efforts, as well as contributing to relief and
              rehabilitation efforts in times of calamities.</p>

            <h3 className='blue'>Government Bodies and Regulators</h3>
            <p>We have always worked closely with the
              government and our regulators—whether on
              developmental, legal, regulatory, or legislative
              matters—and view them as important partners
              in the attainment of the country’s development
              goals. Our regular dialogues with them consist
              of consultation meetings, plant visits, legislative
              hearings, briefings, and conferences, to name
              a few.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, SMC endeavors to maintain
              diligent compliance with all relevant laws and
              regulatory requirements. We conduct financial
              and operational audits to ensure that we fulfill
              all requirements and aim to be at least at
              par with global standards and best industry
              practices. </p>

            <p>Also, we uphold and support national growth
              and progress through collaboration on projects
              and initiatives through the government’s
              Public-Private Partnership programs. By being
              a partner of the government in enhancing the
              country’s infrastructure and transportation
              system along with providing stable power
              supply, we believe that we are contributing to
              the overall economy and helping to improve
              people’s lives. We also closely monitor and
              hold discussions with the government about
              any plans that may affect our products, such as
              tax increases, to ensure that it will be fair and
              acceptable to our consumers.</p>

            <p>As the country is moving forward from the
              worst of the pandemic, we will maintain our
              good working relationship with the government
              to contribute to the country’s continued
              recovery and growth.</p>

            <h3 className='blue'>Financial Institutions</h3>

            <p>Financial institutions are essential partners of
              SMC in our mission to expand and grow our
              multiple businesses, with the ultimate goal
              of helping the nation prosper and progress.
              They provide the funds necessary to support
              our various major undertakings. They have
              been instrumental in successfully assisting
              SMC in our expansion strategy in key areas
              of our business, particularly in infrastructure
              and energy. They assist us with our funding
              activities via bond deals, roadshows, project
              financing, and loans. </p>

            <p>We consistently communicate and engage
              with financial institutions through participation
              in economic briefings, regular market
              updates, credit update calls, and formal email
              correspondence.
            </p>

            <p>Financial institutions also further our
              knowledge about the increasing importance of
              sustainability in our strategies and operations.
              Banks would bring in their sustainability experts
              to assess our sustainable practices and give
              valuable advice on how we can further improve
              our ESG performance and ratings. Through their
              assistance, SMC is able to better convey our
              ESG agenda and goals to our shareholders and
              investors.</p>

            <h3 className='blue'>Media</h3>
            <p>
              We view the media as partners who are central
              in communicating our purpose to the wider
              community. The Company has long-standing
              professional relationships with the media, in
              which we engage and communicate SMC’s
              plans and performance, ensuring responsible
              and transparent management of issues. Press
              briefings, conferences and interviews constitute
              regular channels of engagement with SMC
              key officers including our President and CEO.
              The media are also invited to company events
              such as annual stockholders’ meetings, the
              inauguration of facilities and major projects,
              brand launches, and company-sponsored media
              trainings. While in-person gatherings were
              suspended for the duration of the pandemic,
              virtual exchanges and small group meetings
              with top management were held.
